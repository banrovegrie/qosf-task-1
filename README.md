### About
We design a general circuit that accepts vectors with random values of size n with m bits in length for each element and finds the state(s) such that it is the superposition of indices such that vector elements at those indices have a binary representation with every two adjacent bits having different values.

### Instructions  
1. Install `cirq`, incase not already installed.
2. To find the required superposition state for any input vector, i.e., solve the general problem.
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
3. To test the program, run the `test.py` file. It doesn't involve proving any imputs.
